## USB Type-C-Powered 4-Port USB Hub for Raspberri Pi ##

### Description ###
This device uses USB 3.1's PD protocol to provide up to 50W to a 4-port USB 2.0 hub attached to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi doesn't yet support all the fancy features of USB 3.1 / Type-C yet, the hub itself is only USB 2.0 High Speed compliant (480 Mbps).

### Doc Drink Recipe ###
**Ingredients**
* 2 oz. dark rum (Gosling's Black Seal preferred)
* 3 oz. ginger beer (Barritts preferred)
* 1/2 oz. lime juice (optional)
* Collins glass 

**Directions**
1. Combine the rum, the ginger beer, and the lime juice in a tall glass full of ice cubes.
2. Stir.
3. Garnish with a lime wedge. 
4. Imagine yourself on a beach in Bermuda. The sun is setting as clouds fill the western part of the sky. It's an eerie sort of sunset but the air is cool and smells like salt. You sit on your chair and gaze out over the sea. Lightning dances in the distance and thunder softly rumbles out of time. You take a sip of your drink and sigh, thoughtful for the night ahead. A lone gull cries as it flies toward the coming storm.
